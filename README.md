# Overview

I have created a simple Pig dice game using vanilla JavaScript. The purpose of this software is to provide a digital implementation of the classic Pig dice game that allows players to enjoy the game online without the need for physical dice or boards. Here's a brief description of the software:

Description:

The Pig dice game software is a web-based application that can be played in a web browser.
It replicates the rules and gameplay of the traditional Pig dice game as described earlier, including the ability to roll a virtual die, accumulate points, and make strategic decisions on when to roll or bank points.
The game interface includes elements such as a virtual die, player scores, buttons for rolling and banking, and a message area to inform players about game events and outcomes.
It provides a user-friendly experience with clear instructions and feedback to the players.
Key Features:

Rolling Dice: Players can roll a virtual die with a click of a button.
Score Tracking: The software keeps track of the current turn's score and the total score for each player.
Turn Logic: It enforces the game's rules, including ending a player's turn if they roll a 1.
Winning Condition: The game detects and announces the winner when a player reaches the target score.
Restart: Players can restart the game to play again.

Purpose:
The purpose of creating this software is multifaceted:

Entertainment: To provide a fun and interactive digital version of the Pig dice game that can be enjoyed by individuals or groups of players.
Accessibility: To make the game accessible to a wider audience through a web-based platform, allowing players to enjoy it from their computers or mobile devices.
Learning: As an educational tool for teaching probability concepts, the software can be used by teachers or students to explore risk and decision-making in a playful setting.
Practice: For those interested in mastering Pig's strategy, the software offers a platform to practice and refine their gameplay skills.
Overall, this software aims to deliver an engaging and accessible digital version of the Pig dice game while serving as a useful tool for both entertainment and education.
